# clojure-cl

I'm reading Let Over Lambda, so I thought it might be fun to see how much of Clojure I can implement in Common Lisp using macro/reader macro trickery.

If you look closely, you will see that it's all wrong. Missing things include, but are not limited to:
* Immutability
* Not a Lisp1
* Namespaces
* Clojure style macro composition
* Protocols
* A good test suite
* Organisation

But I'm having fun, just writing code. Those are interesting puzzles for later. I'm enjoying just writing a bunch of lazy utility functions for now.
